Hello everyone.

I have built a shortcut application to gemini assistant to be able to use with devices using Color OS CN (Rooted).
The steps are as follows:

**FOR ROOT USERS**

Step 1: install the Trigger Gemini application I have built (works similar to MiCTS, the application will trigger voice command of the Google application)

Step 2: Install Xposed Edge and active Xposed Edge in Lsposed

Step 3: assign any gesture you find reasonable to activate gemini assistant to open the Trigger Gemini application just installed.

**FOR NON-ROOT USERS**

You can use the smart sidebar feature and add apps to it.

**Note** 
The application may ask to reset the default assistant application every time the device is restarted. Implementation process: set the default assistant application back to None and select Google again => Done
