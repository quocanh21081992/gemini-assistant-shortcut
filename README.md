Hello everyone.

I have built a shortcut application to gemini assistant to be able to use with devices using Color OS CN. Everyone can test this app with china OS (HyperOS, Magic OS, Origin OS).

**FOR ROOT USERS**

The steps are as follows:

Step 1: install the Trigger Gemini application I have built (works similar to MiCTS, the application will trigger voice command of the Google application)

Step 2: Install Xposed Edge and active Xposed Edge in Lsposed

Step 3: Set any gesture you find reasonable to activate gemini assistant to open the Trigger Gemini application just installed.


**FOR NON-ROOT USERS**

You can use the Smart Sidebar feature to open apps.

**Note:** 
The application may ask to reset the default assistant application every time the device is restarted. Implementation process: set the default assistant application back to None and select Google again => Done
