Hello everyone.

I have built a shortcut application to gemini assistant to be able to use with devices using Color OS CN. Everyone can test this app with other china OS (HyperOS, Magic OS, Origin OS).


**Note: Google and Gemini is required.** 

The application may ask to reset the default assistant application every time the device is restarted. Implementation process: set the default assistant application back to None and select Google again => Done

You can install normally then use the Smart Sidebar feature to open apps.

Tks @trung15010852 for icon.
