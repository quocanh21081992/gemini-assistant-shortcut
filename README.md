Hello everyone.

I have built a shortcut application to gemini assistant to be able to use with devices using Color OS CN (Rooted).
The steps are as follows:

**FOR ROOT USERS**

Step 1: install the Gemini Trigger application I have built (works similar to MiCTS, the application will trigger voice command of the Google application)

Step 2: Install Xposed Edge. Xposed edge can be found on the group and activated in lsposed (I am installing hold the bottom edge to launch MiCTS, press the bottom edge twice to open Gemini assistant)

Step 3: assign any gesture you find reasonable to activate gemini assistant to open the Trigger Gemini application just installed.

Note: The application may ask to reset the default assistant application every time the device is restarted. Implementation process: set the default assistant application back to None and select Google again => Done

**FOR NON-ROOT USER **

You can use the smart sidebar feature and add apps to it.
